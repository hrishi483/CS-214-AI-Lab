# CS-214-AI-Lab Group 16
### Most of the assignments are part of UC Berkeley's Pacman project visit the site for more information http://ai.berkeley.edu/project_overview.html
- Assignment1 : Basic Search Algoeithms
- Assignment2 : Heuristic Search for Solving Block's World Problem. Refer to `A First Course in Artificial Intelligence-Deepak Khemani`
- Assignment3 : Travelling Salesman Problem. This is a NP Complete problem thus finding the exact solution for this is not possible given the Time Constraints. We have implemented optimization algorithm: Ant Colony Optimizatiopn. The test_cases gfiven and Hidden are both attached
- Assignment4 : This is the extension of Assignment 1 where we are implementing famous A* and uniform cost search  algorithms.
- Assignment5 : Working with Markov Decision Process by implementing Q Value iterations and value iterations.
- Assignment6 : Solving Othello using the Minimax algorithm and using alpha beta pruning.
- Assignment7 : Building a Decision Tree Classifier from scratch.
- Assignment8 : Reinforcement Learning using Approximate Q Learning.
